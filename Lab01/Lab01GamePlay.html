                The game play is competitive in nature. It is the cult classic style of strategy that made early blizzard famous. The game has three races the player can pick each has a different play style. The terrains have a slower play style. The Protoss are in the middle and the zerg are fast passed. The player must balance mining base economy, unit production, and front line micro management. The players start by setting up a base and mining their minerals for their economy. This quickly moves to an unit on unit warfare. Unit on warfare has different dynamics depending on race and unit types. for example only Specific units can attack air and other have higher attack/deffance. this is really just filler....
